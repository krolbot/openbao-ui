# You must initialize + unseal it (via the API/CLI) before the UI can be used. For
# a quick start prefer dev mode (BAO_DEV=1). Production deployments should mount
# the Raft data path and terminate TLS at the edge.

# Serve OpenBao's stock UI at :8200/ui/. The Next.js BFF proxies /ui/* through
# to it (our own app lives at /ui2/*), so both UIs are reachable side by side.
